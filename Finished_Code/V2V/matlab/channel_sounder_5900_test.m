%%% (1) Connect the Pluto USB to the computer
%%% (2) Connect the Tx port to the spectrum analyzer using a cable
%%% (3) Setup the spectrum analyzer as follows:
%%%     Start Freq = 5880 MHz
%%%     Stop Freq = 5920 MHz
%%% (4) Run this script
%%%     "configurePlutoRadio('AD9364')" takes a few minutes
%%% (5) Take a picture of the Spectrum Analyzer screen.
%%% (6) At the Matlab command prompt, type tx.release
%%% (7) Get a different Pluto radio, go to (1).
