/**
NamingConvention manages the naming convention for capture files.

Members of this class load a naming convention from a file, manage that convention, manage values of the
various fields in the convention, and convert those values to a name that fits the convention.

Naming conventions are stored in a text file. The format of this file is as follows:
Each line is one of a comment, a blank line, a field entry, an option entry, or the end of file marker line.

Comment lines start with '#' and are ignored.
	# This is a comment. I can write anything here.

Field entries start with '$' and are in this format:
	$ [field code] [default value] [separator] [field name]
Where each item is exactly one word, aside from the field name, which can be any number of words.
The default value must be a code for one of the options listed below this field.
The separator here cannot be empty, but if an empty separator in the name is desired use the string "`" here.
Field entries should appear in the order in which their codes are used for the naming convention.

Option entries start with '-' and are in this format:
	- [option code] [option name]
Where option code is exactly one word and option name is any number of words.
Option entries are listed under the field which they are options for.

The end of file marker line is mandatory and consists of exactly `~`:
	~
Behavior is undefined if this line is not present or if there exist lines in the file after this line.

If any line begins with a character other than these four options (leading whitespace and empty lines
are ignored), this class will be unable to read the naming convention file.
