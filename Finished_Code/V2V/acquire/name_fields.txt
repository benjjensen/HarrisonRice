# Naming conventions are stored in a text file. The format of this file is as follows:
# Each line is one of a comment, a blank line, a field entry, an option entry, or the end of file marker line.
# 
# Comment lines start with '#' and are ignored.
#     # This is a comment. I can write anything here.
#
# Field entries start with '$' and are in this format:
#     $ [default value] [separator] [field name]
# Where each item is exactly one word, aside from the field name, which can be any number of words.
# The default value must be a code for one of the options listed below this field.
# The separator here cannot be empty, but if an empty separator in the name is desired use the string "`" here.
# Field entries should appear in the order in which their codes are used for the naming convention.
# 
# Option entries start with '-' and are in this format:
#     - [option code] [option name]
# Where option code is exactly one word and option name is any number of words.
# Option entries are listed under the field which they are options for.
#
# The end of file marker line is mandatory and consists of exactly `~`:
#     ~
# Behavior is undefined if this line is not present or if there exist lines in the file after this line.
#
# If any line begins with a character other than these four options (leading whitespace and empty lines
# are ignored), the naming convention class will be unable to read the naming convention file.
