function [carrier_list,floor] = find_num_carriers(data,threshold)
%find_num_carriers Finds the number of carriers above the specified
%                   threshold
%   Compares each carrier with the noise on the carrier and if the
%   difference is greater than the threshold it is counted as a good
%   carrier.  If there is no data a nan is inputed for the number of
%   carriers.  Alternate method of finding the average noise floor is done
%   by uncommenting the commented code and commenting out the current for
%   loop where the variable is loc.
