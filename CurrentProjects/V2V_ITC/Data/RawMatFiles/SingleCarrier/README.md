This folder contains the raw data for SINGLE CARRIER SCENARIOS gathered on 
March 19, 2019 with Carlos, our Mexican collegue, while driving vans near NuSkin
and the Provo City Center Temple in Provo. The files in this folder were run 
through a correction program to eliminate the first few seconds of corrupted data.
