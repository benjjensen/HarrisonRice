% This file converts the data captured by the receiver and data
% acquisition card to approximately to I/Q (complex-valued) data 
% sampled at 11.2 ksamples/s. 
%
% The input data is real-valued bandpass data sampled at 11.2 Msamples/s.
%
% Change the variable inFilename to the name of the data set you wish to
% convert. Nathan has to do his thing first to make it a .mat file.
%
% Change ther variable outFilename to the name of the file where you wish
% to store the I/Q (complex-valued) data sampled at 11.2 ksamples/s
%
% The resampling is performed in two steps: downsample by 4, then
% downsample by 250.
