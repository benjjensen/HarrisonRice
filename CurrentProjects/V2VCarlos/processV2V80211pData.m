%%% processV2V80211pData

% This file converts the data captured by the receiver and data
% acquisition card to approximately to I/Q (complex-valued) data 
% sampled at 20 Msamples/s. 
%
% The Van data is real-valued bandpass data sampled at 100 Msamples/s.
%
% Change the variable inFilename to the name of the data set you wish to
% convert. Nathan has to do his thing first to make it a .mat file.
%
% Change ther variable outFilename to the name of the file where you wish
% to store the I/Q (complex-valued) data sampled at 10 Msamples/s
%
% You can then reuse most of your code to process the data stored in
% outFilename.
