%threshold_find_num_carriers Finds the number of carriers above the specified

%   Compares each carrier with the noise on the carrier and if the
%   difference is greater than the threshold it is counted as a good
%   carrier. If there is no data a nan is inputed for the number of
%   carriers. Stores the number of carriers in a single column to make
%   finding the max easier, also stores it in the grid form that represents
%   the room
