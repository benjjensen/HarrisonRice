Copy of the all the figures generated for Paper 2, as well as information about
    the code used to generate them and the data used.

(Fig. 6 - three subplots comparing Bob's cap, Eve's cap, and Sec Cap for the three different models):
    Dr. Rice generated the plots (see "The Ox" email chain), but the data used was 'completeDataMatrix' 
    located in '..\Data'. See the readMe in Data for additional information.
