function [signal,noise] = normalize_signal(signal, noisefloor)
% normalize_signal: Normalizes the signal
%   Averages the noise, it then divides the noise out of the signal to
%   account for the AGC (Automatic Gain Control). It then normalizes the
%   signal using the max signal value in Bob's known region. The function
%   returns g^2 and the averaged noise
