    % This file takes the individual arrays generated from data
    % collection and first turns each section or room into a complete
    % three dimensional array that is oriented such that it can be used
    % for the generation of a heatmap (co-ordinate (1,1) is in the top
    % left corner of the array). After each section, or room, has been
    % oriented and combined, those arrays are then inserted into one large
    % array that represents the entire section where our data was
    % collected. Points where we do not have data are represented by NaN's
